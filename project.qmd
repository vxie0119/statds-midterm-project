# **Midterm Project: Rodents in NYC** 

[Rodents in NYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rats_in_New_York_City)
are widespread, as they are in many densely populated areas. As of
October 2023, NYC dropped from the 2nd to the 3rd places in the annual
["rattiest city"
list](https://www.orkin.com/press-room/top-rodent-infested-cities-2023#)
released by a pest control company. Rat sightings in NYC was analyzed
by Dr. Michael Walsh in a [2014 PeerJ
article](https://peerj.com/articles/533/). We investigate this problem
from a different angle with the [NYC Rodent Inspection
data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj/about_data),
provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).
Download the 2022-2023 data by filtering the `INSPECTION_DATE` to
between 11:59:59 pm of 12/31/2021 and 12:00:00 am of 01/01/2024
and `INSPECTION_TYPE` is either `Initial` or `Compliance` (which
should be about 108 MB). Read the meta data information
to understand the data.

## Data Initialization
```{python}
# Importing packages and dataset
import pandas as pd
import pyarrow

data = pd.read_csv("./Rodent_Inspection_Data.csv")

# Listing the columns in vertical order
columns = data.columns.to_series().reset_index(drop=True)
columns
```

## Data cleaning.

+ **There are two zipcode columns: `ZIP_CODE` and `Zipcodes`.
  Which one represent the zipcode of the inspection site? 
  Comment on the data dictionary.**

The column `ZIP_CODE` represents the actual zipcode of the inspection site. When reviewing some of the `Zipcodes` values, I saw that some of them were from different states. Based on the data dictionary, I did not see `Zipcodes` in that file. From this, I can assume that there is no importance with the `Zipcodes` column. 

+ **Summarize the missing information. Are their missing values
  that can be filled using other columns? Fill in those values.**
```{python}
# Checking for missing values in each column
missing_info = data.isnull().sum()

# Summarizing the missing information
missing_info_summary = missing_info[missing_info > 0].sort_values(ascending=False)
missing_info_summary
```

- X_COORD and Y_COORD: (fix) There are many cases where the X and Y coordinates are missing. This can be filled in using the `Location` column. If the `Location` column is missing, we can take the `HOUSE_NUMBER`, `STREET_NAME`, `ZIP_CODE` to reverse geocode and find the X and Y coordinates.

- Zipcodes: This column has many missing values and incorrect values. The data dictionary does not define the intended use of this column so this is a column we can consider storing.

- Borough Boundaries: From the data, we see that the `Borough Boundaries` column has a number associated with a specific borough. We see that:

    - Staten Island = 1
    - Brooklyn = 2
    - Queens = 3 
    - Manhattan = 4
    - Bronx = 5

The values in this column can easily be filled in based on what the `Borough` value is.

- Police Precinct, Community Districts, City Council District: There are an equal number of values that are missing. These values would also be quite difficult to fill in and do not seem to have a purpose in the dataset. We can consider storing these values.

- BIN:

- BBL: The Borough, Block, Lot number (BBL) has the same number of missing values as the Building Identification Number (BIN). We see that there are no missing values for `BORO_CODE`, `BLOCK`, and `LOT` so we can use these values to fill in the BBL.

- Community Board, Council District, Census Tract: There are 10,304 missing values in each of these columns. It is difficult to use information from other columns to fill in the data. In terms of significance for the overall project, it would be best to consider storing these columns.

- NTA: The Neighborhood Tabulation Area cannot be filled using other columns. It would be difficult to fill in the values unless we access a different dataset.

- Location, Latitude, Longitude: With these missing values, they can be used to find each other. If both `Location` and both `Latitude` and `Longitude` values are missing, we can use the `Street Name` and `House Name` to potentially locate all of the missing information. `ZIP_CODE` is also another column that may help our investigation.

- ZIP_CODE: By using information from the `Location` and  `Street Name` column, we can locate the zipcode using a geospatial python package.

- HOUSE_NUMBER:

- STREET_NAME:

- RESULT:

- BOROUGH:

+ **Are their redundant information in the data? Try storing
  the data using `arrow` and comment on the efficiency gain.**

From the previous part

+ **Are there invalid zipcode or borough? Justify and clean
  them up if yes.**

## Data exploration.

+ **Create binary variable `passing` indicating passing or
  not for the inspection result. Does `passing` depend on
  whether the inspection is initial or compliance? State
  your hypothesis and summarize your test result.**

+ **Are the passing pattern different across different
  boroughs for initial inspections? How about compliance
  inspections? State your hypothesis and summarize your
  test results.**

+ **If we suspect that the passing rate may depends on
  the time of a day of the inspection, we may compare
  the passting rates for inspections done in the mornings
  and inspections one in the afternoons. Visualize the
  comparison by borough and inspection type.**

+ **Perform a formal hypothesis test to confirm the
  observations from your visualization.**

## Data analytics.
+ **Aggregate the inspections by zip code to create
  a dataset with five columns. The first three columns are
  `zipcode`; `n_initial`, the
  count of the initial inspections in that zipcode; and 
  `n_initpass`, the number of initial inspections with a
  passing result in that zipcode. The other two variables
  are `n_compliance` and `n_comppass`, the counterpart
  for compliance inspections.**

+ **Add a variable to your dataset, `n_sighting`, which
  represent the number of rodent sightings from the 311
  service request data in the same 2022-2023 period.**

+ **Merge your dataset with the simple zipcode table in
  package `uszipcode` by zipcode to obtain demographic
  and socioeconomic variables at the zipcode level.**

+ **Build a binomial regression for the passing rate of initial
  inspections at the zipcode level. Assess the goodness-of-fit
  of your model. Summarize your results to a New Yorker
  who is not data science savvy.**

##  Research Question

   Now you know the data quite well. Come up with a research
   question of interest that can be answered by the data, which
   could be analytics or visualizations. Perform the needed
   analyses and answer your question.
