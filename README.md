# Midterm Project: Rodent Inspection Data in NYC

This repository contains code corresponding to the work done from a midterm project completed in STAT 3255: Introduction to Data Science. This project was presented during NYC OpenData Week 2024 and a release with the slides and report are provided in this repository. The class notes can be found at the [Stats-DS](https://github.com/statds/ids-s24) github page.

The data required can be found on the [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj/about_data) webpage. To get the same csv file, filter the `INSPECTION_DATE` to between 11:59:59PM of 12/31/21 and 12:00:00AM of 01/01/2024. Filter `INSPECTION_TYPE` to either `Initial` or `Compliance`. Download this filtered data in a csv file named `rodents_2022-2023.csv`. 

*Analysis results may vary as the data is constantly being updated.*
